# EasyLexi-Decoding-Difficulties-for-Dyslexics
Dyslexia - a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words, 1 in 10 people suffer from dyslexia.
Most of us have heard about Dyslexia, but how many of us have tried to understand the fear, nervousness and confusion that they face on a daily basis, as students, as working professionals, as people ?

EasyLexi is a technological solution designed to help dyslexic people overcome this fear, this anxiety, this confusion by providing them a platform to get more comfortable with words and sounds. It is aimed at decoding the difficulty. In this era of technological solutions, our goal is to achieve equity and solve challenges that people encounter on a daily basis. We hope that with EasyLexi, people with dyslexia can become more familiar and comfortable. 

EasyLexi has features such as text to audio conversions, audio to text conversions which would help people with reading texts, checking spellings in documents, spell correctly by converting speech to text. It also provides a space where people with dyslexia can connect and explore together. Eg: There will be a 'Word of the Day' daily making them more comfortable with certain words which they may find confusing

We have used CSS, HTML, JavaScript to build and design the website of EasyLexi. Using python, we incorporated text-speech, speech-text, text correction conversions through various packages. The pythonanywhere tool and flask was used to integrate the front-end and back-end developments. 

Challenges to link the various types of files was a little challenging. Testing and making sure all components were running perfectly also posed a bit challenge. 

Working with different software, different tools, definitely was a great experience and we could learn a lot of new things that goes into making a completely functional website with ML features. Our true goal  will be achieved when dyslexic people find it more convenient and become more comfortable. 

We aim at providing more features in a customised manner to our users in the future as well as developing mobile applications for the same.
